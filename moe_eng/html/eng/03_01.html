    <h4>Education system in Korea</h4>
    <h5>Korean Education System</h5>
    <div>
        <img src="../../img/eng/content/03_01_img01.svg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p> 
        Korean education uses a 6-3-3-4 single ladder system - six years in elementary school, three years each in middle school and high
        school, and four years in university. All citizens have equal access to education based on their ability regardless of their social
        status or position. The nine years of elementary and middle school are compulsory, but from high school and beyond, students choose an
        education path in line with their career choice.
    </p>
    <h4>Early childhood education, the first step in addressing learning gaps</h4>
    <p> 
        Childcare and development programs are offered at kindergartens for children ages 3 and older and daycare centers for babies and
        toddlers. In accordance with relevant laws, these two entities operate differently. Overall enrollment rate is 98.2%: 3-year-olds
        accounts for 98.2%, 4-year-olds, 95.8%, and 5-year-olds, 90.2%—all are much higher than the average of OECD countries. Thanks to the
        heightened public awareness of the role of early childhood education, kindergarten enrollment has risen from 26.2% in 2000 to
        48.9% in 2021.
    </p>
    <p> 
        To guarantee equal educational opportunities from early life, the government is expanding the state’s responsibility for early
        childhood education. In particular, the government-funded Nuri Curriculum helps relieve burden on parents, offering more
        opportunities for early childhood education. The curriculum was launched in 2012 for five-year-olds and then expanded to three- and
        four-year-olds in 2013. Government policies to increase public accountability for kindergartens include statutory improvement in
        learning opportunities for children, expansion of public kindergarten services, encouragement of parental involvement, and a
        new accounting system for private kindergarten operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Elementary and Secondary Education - Guaranteeing Equal Educational Opportunities
    </h4>
    <p> Korea’s compulsory elementary education began in 1950 and advanced in phases over the next 30 years. Starting in 1985,
        compulsory middle school education was introduced and expanded regionally, starting with small-and medium-sized cities in rural
        areas, then larger cities, and finally Seoul, with nationwide implementation in 2004. Most schools are public, and the same level
        of education based on the national curriculum is provided free of charge.
    </p>
    <p> Students graduating from middle school or those who passed a qualification exam providing equivalent credits are eligible to
        attend three-year high schools. High schools are classified as general, vocational, schools for gifted students, special purpose
        high schools (for science, arts, physical education, etc.), and autonomous high schools that have more autonomy over school
        administration and curricula. Students are free to select the high school that is consistent with their career goals. While high school
        education is not currently compulsory, it is nearly universal with an enrollment rate of 99.7%. Accordingly, the government instituted
        free high school education in 2019 to reduce the financial burden on parents.
    </p>

    <h4>Higher education emphasis on nurturing</h4>
    <p> Tertiary education is open to those having a high school diploma or equivalent credentials recognized by laws. College
        admissions decisions are made significantly based on College Scholastic Ability Test scores and other factors, such as school
        records. There are colleges, junior colleges, colleges of education for elementary school teacher candidates, and online colleges, just
        to name a few.
    </p>
    <p> Because of education zeal, enrollment in higher education institutions, which stayed below 10% prior to the 1980s, hit 67.8%
        in 2019. In 2019, out of 430 higher education establishments, 372 were private, accounting for 86.5%. Since 2012, the government has
        implemented the national scholarship program with the goal of assisting all who are thirsty for post-secondary opportunities and
        options, as well as dormitory expansion and measures to ease housing burdens. As a central point for cultivating creative and innovative
        individuals, colleges are encouraged to provide tailor-made courses reflecting education consumers’ needs.
    </p>

    <h4>Vocational Education - Promoting the “Job First, University Later”</h4>
    <p> Vocational education in Korea technically begins at the level of upper-secondary education. The majority of vocational education
        takes place in specialized vocational high schools, whereas Meister high schools offer industrial demand-driven courses, along with a
        number of general high schools that provide vocational education programs as part of their curriculum. The latest data (as of April
        2020) reveals that there are 576 vocational high schools in Korea, accounting for 24.3% of all high schools, with 18.5% of high school
        students enrolled.
    </p>
    <p> The government’s employment support system connects the central government, local offices of education and schools in
        helping students find more job opportunities after graduation. The newly established Central Employment Support Center is responsible
        for identifying companies with good future prospects and shares the information with the employment support centers under the
        metropolitan and provincial offices of education. The recent “Job First, University Later” initiative helps students get a job at an
        earlier age and also allows them to pursue higher education whenever they want after getting a job in order to advance their competency.
        Other support includes expansion of the college curricula for working students and tuition assistance to help them reach their
        career goals.
    </p>

    <h4>Substantial assistance for special education</h4>
    <p> Kindergarten and elementary, middle, and high schools are mandatory for people with disabilities. Children younger than 3
        years of age and high school graduates who aspire to get a 1-year career course, which is operated by designated institutes, also
        qualify for free tuition. Special education recipients are entitled not only to a curriculum that embraces the nature of disability but
        also to related services—counseling, treatment, assistive technology devices, etc. Since the enactment of the Special Education Promotion
        Act of 1978, the government has increased special education public schools. The enactment of the Act on Special Education for Persons
        with Disabilities, etc. in 2007 led to broadening the scope of free compulsory education and support, facilitating the construction of
        institutions, recruiting more teachers, and strengthening disability inclusion in education and occupational training. As of April 2021,
        a total number of students deemed eligible for special education and services is 98,154, which has been steadily increasing from year to
        year. Those attending special education schools and special education support centers and those enrolled in traditional schools
        (specialized or inclusive classroom) occupy 27.8% and 72.2%, respectively.
    </p>

    <h4>Greater Access to Lifelong Education</h4>
    <p> Lifelong education in Korea incorporates systematic educational activities of six areas: complementary schooling; adult
        literacy education; vocational education; liberal arts/culture/arts education; and civic participation education. Starting with the
        introduction of the Bachelor’s Degree Examination for Self-Education in 1990, the government’s support for lifelong education is
        demonstrated in the Academic Credit Bank System and Part-time Enrollment System in1995, Accounts for Lifelong Learning (ALL) in
        2006, and a Lifelong-Learning University Project in 2008. In addition, semi-formal lifelong education institutions and online
        education systems are offered beyond the barriers of time and space for lifelong learning.
    </p>

    <h4>Education - One of the Substantial Governmental Expenditures</h4>
    <div class="img_center">
        <h5>Public education expenditure per pupil</h5>
        <div>
            <img src="../../img/eng/content/03_01_img02.svg" alt="">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p> The Korean government has been gradually increasing its spending on education over the last 40 years, and in 2020, the
        government spent 75.7 trillion won or four times the 19.2 trillion won spent in 2000. During these 20 years, Korea annually earmarked
        15-20% of its total budget for education, the highest among OECD countries relative to their GDP.
    </p>
    <p> National and educational taxes fund the education budget, and local governments receive revenue from subsidies disbursed by the
        central government and local taxes. In 2020, funds from the central government accounted for 72.6% of local education budgets, and
        income from local taxes accounted for 17.3%, which improved the local education finances and ensured students receive a quality
        education regardless of where they live. The government’s education budget funds the offices of education that oversee elementary and
        secondary school education, operate national universities and ducational administrative/research organizations, and provide
        partial subsidies for private universities which mostly depend on admission and tuition fees to meet their operational costs.
    </p>

    <h4>Curriculum and curriculum book</h4>
    <h5>Curriculum (National Curriculum Policy Division)</h5>
    <p> We oversee the national curriculum under Article 23 of the Elementary and Secondary School Education Act—to ensure the equality
        of educational opportunities and maintain the quality of education. The national curriculum and local guidelines give individual schools
        flexibility, depending on the specific characteristics and goals of he school.
    </p>
    <p> Revised periodically, the national curriculum encompasses social change, the emerging demand for education, and new horizons
        in the field of study.
    </p>
    <p> Curriculum standards are the basis for each school's academic content and textbook development. The national curriculum changed 10times.</p>

    <p> Introduced on December 30, 1997, the 7th Curriculum was used in 1st and 2nd grades in 2000, in 3rd and 4th grades in 2001, and in
        5th and 6th grades in 2002, thereby being able to cover 12th graders in 2004.
    </p>
    <p> Preparing for the 21st century, the era of globalization and knowledge-based society, the 7th Curriculum was crafted to foster
        people poised to confront challenges—with a new approach in the classroom. We decreased the amount of learning for each subject to
        an appropriate level and adapted a curriculum fulfilling the diverse needs of students and situations. Movement toward an increase in
        self-directed learning was a viable task, which would contribute to knowledge society.
    </p>
    <p> Therefore, unlike previous versions, the student-centered 7th Curriculum accentuated an individual’s creativity and aptitude and
        defined an educated person as follows:
    </p>
    <ul data-list="count">
        <li><em>1</em>Person pursuing individuality as the foundation of personal growth</li>
        <li><em>2</em>Person demonstrating ultimate creativity</li>
        <li><em>3</em>Person seeking potential career pathways in a wide cultural spectrum</li>
        <li><em>4</em>Person generating new value based on an understanding of national culture</li>
        <li><em>5</em>Person making a contribution to community development based on democratic citizenship</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Consisting of core courses and electives at high school levels, the 7th Curriculum covers from 1st to 10th grade. The
        general public can receive basic education important to daily life.
    </p>
    <p> During 11th and 12th grades, students are given the opportunity to choose their desired subjects and courses that will
        make them create a career map.
    </p>
    <p> After the 7th Curriculum was formulated, educational content and structure were reorganized, and the curriculum could be revised
        and updated often to meet social and cultural needs. Since 2007, the year of curriculum revision has been specified in the name, like the
        2007 Revised Curriculum.
    </p>
    <p> The 2015 Revised Curriculum, which is currently in use, removes high school curriculum tracks: liberal arts and
        sciences—with the aim of unleashing the humanities imagination and scientific and technological creativity of creative convergence
        talent. The followings are the characters of a person which the 2015 Revised Curriculum lays stress on.
    </p>
    <ul data-list="count">
        <li><em>1</em>Well-rounded person who has a positive self-concept and reclaims his or her career and life</li>
        <li><em>2</em>Creative person with basic abilities who hallenges his or her ideas</li>
        <li><em>3</em>Educated person who enjoys human culture on the basis of cultural literacy and respect for pluralism</li>
        <li><em>4</em>Democratic and global person who considers and shares with other people based on a sense of community</li>
    </ul>
    <p> In order to nurture the person as above mentioned, the competences we endeavor to instill in students throughout the entire
        educational process are as follows.
    </p>

    <h5>Curriculum book</h5>
    <p> Curriculum books manifest and translate the important elements of the curriculum. According to the user-based classification,
        curriculum books include textbooks and instructional guides—print and digital versions, audio recordings, and videos.
    </p>
    <p> Curriculum books can be also divided into three types: government-designated, authorized, and approved textbooks.
    </p>
    <p> The copyright in government-designated textbooks is owned by the Ministry of Education. Authorized textbooks require an
        inspection by the Minister of Education, and approved textbooks must acquire approval from the superintendent of education, a delegator
        of the Minister of Education. Approved textbooks are used only when there are no government-designated or authorized textbooks available
        or when government-designated or authorized textbooks need supplemental materials.
